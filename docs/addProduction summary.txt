Absolutely, Fred—here’s a full summary of everything we’ve covered so far, cleanly 
organized so you can copy-paste and refer back to it whenever needed:

## 🧩 Modal Workflow Summary – Add Production Log

### 🗺️ Form Structure
- **Three logical sections**:
  - Log & Material Usage (Part Name, Date, Run Status, Hopper Data)
  - Dryer, Press & HotRunner Inputs
  - Comments & Submit Controls

### 🚦 Run Status Behavior
- **Start (1)**:
  - After Hopper 1–4 are entered, copy values directly into daily usage fields.
  - Calculate material usage percentages and populate percent fields.
  - Totals for Blender, Daily, and Percentage are auto-calculated.
  - Validates whether a production run already exists for this product/date.

- **In Progress (0)** and **End (2)**:
  - Fetch previous material log.
  - Subtract previous from current to populate daily usage.
  - Calculate percentages and fill in total usage fields.
  - For **End**, additionally:
    - Fetch all logs tied to runLogID
    - Aggregate totals for materials, rejects, purge
    - Update production_run record and set `Completed = yes`.

## 🧠 Old Code Review (Pre-Modular)

### ✅ Key Functions
- `addBlenderOnBlur()` handled behavior after hopper weights were filled
- `getAndSetDailyUsage()` calculated and updated daily usage/percentages
- `doPercentage()` performed percentage math with fallback for 0 division
- `fetchPreviousMatLogs()` retrieved material usage from prior log
- `showAlertMessage()` injected Bootstrap alert into modal
- Validated production date uniqueness and checked for existing active run

## 🧱 Modular Refactor Blueprint

### 🔹 `productionApiClient.js`
- All fetch/POST logic:
  - Get product & material lists
  - Check run/log existence
  - Fetch previous log
  - Submit production log
  - Roll up "end" data

### 🔹 `productionUiManager.js`
- All DOM interaction:
  - Fill selects
  - Populate usage fields and percentages
  - Reset and show/hide modal
  - Display loader and alerts

### 🔹 `productionMain.js`
- Event orchestration:
  - On modal show → preload selects
  - On radio change → set `runMode`
  - On hopper blur → trigger calculation workflow
  - On submit → validate + send payload

## 💡 Technical Notes

- **Only Hoppers 1 & 2 are required**—3 & 4 are optional and handled conditionally.
- Used `requestAnimationFrame()` and a `setTimeout()` to ensure loader displays before fetch.
- Moved all logic out of inline events into attached listeners for modularity.
- Prevented default behavior on `<a href="#">` links and modal buttons to avoid unwanted reloads.
- Added a fallback timer to prevent loaders from hanging if modal fails to render.

If you'd like, I can also turn this into a Markdown doc you can drop into your project’s `/docs` 
folder, or help you bootstrap the new `productionApiClient.js` module and stub out each method. Want 
to start with that next?
