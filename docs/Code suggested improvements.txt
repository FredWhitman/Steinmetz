Below are several recommendations to optimize and improve your code—these are suggestions that you can adopt gradually. I won’t make any changes to your repository; instead, consider incorporating these ideas as you see fit.

---

### **1. Adopt a Consistent Coding Standard**

- **PSR Standards:**  
  Follow PHP Standards Recommendations (PSR-1, PSR-2/PSR-12) for file formatting, naming conventions, and overall code style. This will make your code easier to read and maintain.

- **Commenting and Documentation:**  
  Add inline documentation (using PHPDoc) for your classes, methods, and functions. This not only clarifies intent for other developers (or future you) but also helps with IDE autocompletion and static analysis tools.

---

### **2. Separate Concerns & Consider an MVC Approach**

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):**  
  Even if you don’t switch frameworks, you can reorganize your code so that logic for data handling (the Model), business rules (Controller), and presentation (View) are clearly separated. For example, moving all SQL queries into dedicated model classes and keeping controller files as lightweight coordinators.

- **Reusable Components:**  
  Look for common functionalities (such as error handling, logging, sanitization, and database connection management) and abstract them into helper classes or traits.

---

### **3. Enhance Database Interaction**

- **Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:**  
  You’re using prepared statements, which is excellent. Double-check that you’re handling type binding and error conditions uniformly.  
- **Connection Management:**  
  Consider using dependency injection to pass your PDO connection into your classes. This enables better testing (unit tests) and more flexible configuration.
- **Indexing and Query Optimization:**  
  Verify that frequently queried fields (like productID, runComplete, etc.) are indexed in your database. A well‑optimized query can significantly improve performance.

---

### **4. Improve Error Handling and Logging**

- **Centralized Error Handling:**  
  Use try/catch blocks in higher-level controller segments to catch unexpected errors and log them in a standardized way. Consider building a small error handler class that logs errors to a file or external logging service.
- **Detailed Logging:**  
  It’s great that you’re already using `error_log()`. Consider tracking more context with each log entry (such as the method name or input parameters) to make debugging easier in production.

---

### **5. Refactor and DRY Up Your Code**

- **Avoid Duplication:**  
  Look at your code for repeated patterns—if you find that several routines look very similar (for example, multiple insert/update operations in your transaction flows), factor that logic into reusable functions or methods.
- **Modularize Your Code:**  
  Organize your code into classes or modules with clear responsibilities. For instance, creating a separate Database class for handling all DB operations can simplify error management and allow for easier swapping of database backends if needed.
  
- **Environment Configurations:**  
  Keep your configuration separate (database credentials, environment settings, etc.) in one configuration file, and use environment variables when possible.

---

### **6. Optimize Client-Side JavaScript**

- **Event Handling:**  
  You’re using event listeners well. Ensure that DOM queries (like `document.querySelectorAll(...)`) are cached if used repeatedly, and consider using delegation for dynamic elements.
- **Asynchronous Handling:**  
  Use a unified approach for all fetch calls. Consider centralized error handling for AJAX requests (or even create a small helper to wrap fetch so you can consistently handle errors, logging, and timeouts).
- **Minification and Bundling:**  
  For production, consider bundling and minifying your JavaScript (and CSS) to reduce load times. Tools like Webpack or Parcel can help automate this.

---

### **7. Testing and Continuous Integration**

- **Unit and Integration Testing:**  
  Start writing tests for key functions in your codebase (both on the PHP and JavaScript sides). This can prevent regressions and help you refactor safely.
- **Use Static Analysis:**  
  Tools like PHPStan or Psalm can help detect potential issues in your PHP code. For JavaScript, ESLint can flag code quality issues before deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  If you aren’t already using one, consider integrating continuous integration (CI) tools to automatically run tests and linters when you update your Git repository.

---

### **8. Evaluate Framework Adoption**

- **Lightweight Frameworks:**  
  While it’s not necessary to switch everything over immediately, you may evaluate using a lightweight framework (like Slim or CodeIgniter) for routing and structure. Frameworks enforce patterns that aid maintainability and scalability.
- **Composer for Dependency Management:**  
  Even if you decide not to switch frameworks, using Composer to manage dependencies can simplify including third-party libraries that may improve your error logging, templating, and database interactions.

### **Conclusion**

These suggestions span across code style, structure, database handling, error logging, client-side improvements, and testing. Optimizations often come in small, incremental improvements that vastly improve maintainability and performance over time. Since you prefer not to change your GitHub implementation directly, consider integrating these ideas gradually—experiment by refactoring a few modules at a time to see how they improve your workflow.
